/**
 * The canonical Vidra social card — one template for every surface.
 *
 * Rasterises the README banner, centred on an Ink 1200×630 ground, to a PNG.
 * Crawlers that matter (X, Slack, older LinkedIn) drop SVG cards, so each
 * consuming repo commits the PNG and regenerates it from here whenever the
 * banner changes: vidra-site's `public/brand/og-card.png` and the docs' social
 * card both come from this script, not from per-repo exports. The artwork
 * stays inside a centred ~1120×550 safe area for crop tolerance.
 *
 * The banner must not carry a `prefers-color-scheme` switch — the lockup
 * failure class: an asset that flips with the OS mode renders Ink-on-Ink when
 * rasterised onto a fixed Ink ground. The check below is mechanical and fails
 * the run; if the banner ever grows a switch, render a fixed-ground variant
 * instead. Never let the rasteriser pick a mode.
 *
 * Renders with Playwright Chromium and no other dependency. This repo does
 * not ship one, so the loader also resolves Playwright from the *calling*
 * repo — run it from any checkout that has Playwright installed (vidra-site
 * does):
 *
 *   node ../vidra-branding/assets/social/og-card.mjs public/brand/og-card.png
 *
 * Usage: node og-card.mjs [output.png] [banner.svg]
 *   output.png  where to write the card (default: ./og-card.png)
 *   banner.svg  the artwork (default: this repo's assets/readme/banner.svg)
